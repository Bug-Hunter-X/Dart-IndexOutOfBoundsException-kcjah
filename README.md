# Dart IndexOutOfBoundsException Example

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element of a list using an index that is out of range. This results in an exception at runtime. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to prevent this error using appropriate checks.
